As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Getir is a Turkish technology company that operates in the on-demand delivery sector. The business model of Getir revolves around providing a quick and convenient way for customers to order and receive a variety of products, including groceries and household items, through its mobile app.

Here are key aspects of Getir's business model:

On-Demand Delivery:
Getir focuses on delivering a wide range of products to customers within minutes of placing an order. This quick delivery model is one of the main differentiators of the company.

Mobile App Platform:
Getir operates primarily through its mobile application, available for both iOS and Android devices. Customers can browse through the app, select the items they need, and place an order with just a few taps.

Product Assortment:
Getir typically offers a selection of products that includes groceries, snacks, beverages, household items, and some other daily essentials. The emphasis is on providing a curated selection of commonly needed items for immediate consumption or use.

Dark Stores or Micro-Fulfillment Centers:
Getir utilizes a network of dark stores or micro-fulfillment centers strategically located in urban areas. These facilities are designed to optimize the picking and packing process, enabling fast deliveries.

Rapid Delivery System:
The company prides itself on its ultra-fast delivery model, promising delivery times within minutes. This is achieved through efficient logistics and distribution systems, often involving a fleet of delivery riders.

Subscription Model:
Getir may offer a subscription model where customers can pay a monthly fee to access benefits such as free or discounted deliveries and other perks. This can encourage customer loyalty and repeat business.

Technology and Data-driven Operations:
Getir employs technology to optimize its operations. This includes route optimization algorithms for delivery, inventory management systems, and data analytics to understand customer behavior and preferences.

Expansion and Global Presence:
Getir has expanded its operations beyond Turkey and entered international markets, including Europe. This expansion allows the company to tap into new customer bases and grow its market share.

It's important to note that business models can evolve over time, and there may have been changes or additions to Getir's business model since my last update. For the latest and most accurate information, I recommend checking the company's official website or recent news sources.
